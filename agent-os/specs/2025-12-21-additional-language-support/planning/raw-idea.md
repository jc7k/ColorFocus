# Raw Idea

Add support for an additional language to the ColorFocus Stroop puzzle app, following the same pattern used for Vietnamese language support.

## Context

The user wants to extend the language support in the ColorFocus app. The specific language has not yet been determined, but the implementation should follow the same pattern that was established for Vietnamese language support.

## Initial Notes

- Leverage existing Vietnamese language support implementation as a reference
- Follow established patterns for localization
- Maintain consistency with current UI/UX
