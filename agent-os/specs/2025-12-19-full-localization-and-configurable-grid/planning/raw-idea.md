# Raw Feature Idea

## Original Description

"The in-game instructions and status labels should all match the language selected for the game board. Also, allow the user to choose the dimension of the game board all the way from 1x1 to 8x8. This allows them to slowly ramp the difficulty of the task."

## Context

This feature request is for the ColorFocus Stroop puzzle app and encompasses two distinct enhancements:

1. **Full Localization**: Extend language support beyond just the puzzle grid to include all in-game instructions and status labels
2. **Configurable Grid Dimensions**: Allow users to select grid sizes ranging from 1x1 to 8x8 for progressive difficulty ramping
