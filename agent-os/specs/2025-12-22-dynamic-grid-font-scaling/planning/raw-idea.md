Dynamic Grid and Font Scaling for ColorFocus Puzzle

As the grid size decreases from 8x8 down to 2x2, the puzzle blocks and fonts should scale up proportionally to fill the same available space. The scaling needs to be language-aware since different languages have different word lengths (Chinese characters vs English/Spanish/Vietnamese words). Words need to fit within blocks with appropriate margins for legibility.

This is for the ColorFocus Stroop puzzle app - a cognitive training tool for stroke patients and elderly users.
