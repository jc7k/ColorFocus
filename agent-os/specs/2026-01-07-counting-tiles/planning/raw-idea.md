# Raw Idea: Counting Tiles

## User Description

The user wants to create a spec for counting tiles in the ColorFocus Stroop test application.

## Feature Request

Add a "counting tiles" feature to the ColorFocus application.

## Context

ColorFocus is a Stroop test cognitive training application designed primarily for stroke recovery patients and elderly users. The app currently displays color words (e.g., "BLUE") rendered in different ink colors, creating Stroop interference patterns for cognitive exercise.

This new feature would add tile counting capabilities to enhance cognitive training exercises.
