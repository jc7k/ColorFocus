# CLAUDE.md Structure

AI-first context file for Claude Code and similar AI assistants.

## Required Sections

1. **Quick Start** — What to read first, how to verify behavior
2. **Guidelines** — Numbered rules for AI behavior (customize per project)
3. **Session Handoff** — How to resume work across sessions
4. **Architecture** — Directory structure, data flow, key patterns
5. **Key Constraints** — Non-negotiables (accessibility, security, etc.)

## Optional Sections

- **Environment Setup** — First-time setup commands
- **Commands** — Common CLI commands with examples
- **Common Tasks** — CLI vs Web capability matrix
- **Protected Files** — Files requiring extra review

## Template Guidelines (customize as needed)

1. Read codebase before making changes
2. Check in before major changes
3. Explain changes at high level
4. Keep changes simple and minimal
5. Never speculate about unread code
6. Assume no context from previous sessions

## Key Principles

- Lead with actionable info (Quick Start first)
- Include live URLs for behavior verification
- List file paths explicitly (AI can't guess)
- Use tables for capability matrices
