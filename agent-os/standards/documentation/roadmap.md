# Roadmap Format

Product roadmap structure for tracking features and priorities.

## Structure

```markdown
# Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: [Theme Name]

1. [x] **Feature Name** — Brief description of what it does.
2. [ ] **Another Feature** — Description here.

## Phase 2: [Theme Name]

3. [ ] **Feature** — Description.

> Notes
> - Order reflects dependencies and value delivery
> - Each item is a complete, testable feature
```

## Rules

- Use numbered list for sequencing
- Use `[x]` for complete, `[ ]` for pending
- Bold the feature name
- One sentence description after em-dash
- Group into phases by theme (MVP, Scoring, Export, etc.)
- Include Notes section explaining ordering rationale

## Phase Naming

Common phase patterns:
- **Phase 1: MVP** — Core experience, minimum viable
- **Phase 2: Engagement** — Retention, tracking, dashboards
- **Phase 3: Scale** — Export, integrations, advanced features

## Item Format

```
N. [x] **Feature Name** — What it does and why it matters.
```

Keep descriptions to one sentence. Details go in specs, not roadmap.
