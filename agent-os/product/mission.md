# Product Mission

## Pitch

ColorFocus is a lightweight web application that helps older adults, post-stroke patients, and their caregivers maintain and improve cognitive function through evidence-based visual attention puzzles, with strong accessibility guarantees including color-blind-safe modes.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Older Adults**: Individuals experiencing mild cognitive decline who want to maintain mental sharpness through regular cognitive exercises
- **Post-Stroke Patients**: People in home-based recovery seeking accessible, self-directed cognitive rehabilitation tools

### Secondary Customers
- **Family Caregivers**: Family members supporting loved ones' cognitive health who need simple tools to track progress
- **Occupational Therapists**: Clinicians looking for lightweight at-home cognitive screening and exercise tools
- **Clinicians**: Healthcare providers seeking evidence-based cognitive assessment supplements

### User Personas

**Margaret** (72)
- **Role:** Retired teacher living independently
- **Context:** Notices occasional memory lapses and wants to stay mentally active
- **Pain Points:** Most brain training apps are too fast-paced, have small text, or rely on color distinctions she cannot see clearly
- **Goals:** Daily cognitive exercises that feel achievable and help her track improvement over time

**David** (58)
- **Role:** Post-stroke patient in home recovery
- **Context:** Working with occupational therapist on attention and executive function recovery
- **Pain Points:** Needs exercises that can be done independently between therapy sessions, with clear progress tracking for his care team
- **Goals:** Structured cognitive practice that builds confidence and demonstrates measurable improvement

**Sarah** (45)
- **Role:** Family caregiver for her mother
- **Context:** Lives remotely and wants to support her mother's cognitive health
- **Pain Points:** Needs visibility into her mother's engagement and progress without being intrusive
- **Goals:** Simple dashboard showing activity trends and areas of improvement or concern

## The Problem

### Cognitive Decline Lacks Accessible Home-Based Tools

Older adults and post-stroke patients often lack accessible, evidence-based tools for cognitive maintenance and rehabilitation at home. Existing solutions frequently have small fonts, rely heavily on color differentiation, move too quickly, or require complex navigation. This creates barriers for the populations who need these tools most.

**Our Solution:** Grid-based Stroop-style word jungle puzzles that train selective attention, visual search, inhibitory control, and working memory. The interface prioritizes accessibility with large fonts, color-blind-safe palettes, adjustable spacing, and printable layouts.

### Caregivers Lack Visibility

Family members and clinicians supporting cognitive health have limited insight into at-home practice without burdensome check-ins or complex medical software.

**Our Solution:** A caregiver dashboard providing weekly summaries, trend visualization, and exportable reports without requiring technical expertise or constant supervision.

## Differentiators

### Accessibility-First Design
Unlike general brain training apps, ColorFocus is built from the ground up for users with visual impairments, motor limitations, and cognitive challenges. Every design decision prioritizes the needs of older adults and recovery patients.

### Evidence-Based Cognitive Training
The Stroop paradigm is one of the most well-researched cognitive assessment and training tools in neuropsychology. ColorFocus applies this scientific foundation to accessible daily practice.

### Color-Blind-Safe by Default
The 8-token color system (BLUE, ORANGE, PURPLE, BLACK, CYAN, AMBER, MAGENTA, GRAY) with Chinese single-character labels and brightness variants ensures puzzles work for users with various forms of color vision deficiency.

### Caregiver Integration
Built-in progress tracking and reporting features enable family members and clinicians to monitor engagement and improvement without complex medical software.

## Key Features

### Core Puzzle Features
- **Grid-Based Word Jungle Puzzles:** 8x8 grids of color words rendered in different ink colors, creating Stroop interference that trains attention and inhibitory control
- **Color Counting Task:** Users count occurrences of each ink color while ignoring word meaning, building visual search and working memory skills
- **Automatic Answer Keys:** Every generated puzzle includes a verified answer key for self-assessment

### Accessibility Features
- **Color-Blind-Safe Palette:** 8 canonical color tokens with brightness variants designed for deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia
- **Large Sans-Serif Fonts:** Clear, readable typography optimized for older eyes
- **Adjustable Grid Spacing:** Configurable density to accommodate various visual and motor abilities
- **Printable Layouts:** Generate PDF versions for offline practice or clinical use

### Difficulty Progression
- **Tier 1 (Accessible/Recovery):** Simplified grids for users beginning cognitive rehabilitation
- **Tier 2 (Standard):** Balanced difficulty for daily practice
- **Tier 3 (Advanced):** Challenging puzzles for users seeking greater cognitive demand

### Progress Tracking Features
- **Scoring Metrics:** Accuracy, completion time, and error distribution analysis
- **Caregiver Dashboard:** At-a-glance view of user activity and performance trends
- **Weekly Summaries:** Automated progress reports highlighting patterns and improvements
- **Trend Visualization:** Charts showing performance over time
- **Exportable PDF Reports:** Professional summaries for sharing with healthcare providers

## Success Criteria

- Users can complete puzzles independently without assistance
- Color-blind users can distinguish all color tokens without error
- Caregivers can access meaningful progress summaries in under 2 minutes
- Average puzzle completion time decreases with regular practice (within user's tier)
- User accuracy improves over 4-week usage periods
- Puzzles can be printed and completed offline with readable formatting

## Non-Goals

- **Medical Diagnosis:** ColorFocus does not diagnose cognitive conditions or replace clinical assessment
- **Color Vision Testing:** The app does not measure or assess color vision capabilities
- **Competitive Gamification:** No leaderboards, achievements, or social competition features that may create anxiety
- **Automatic Hue Adjustment:** Colors are fixed by design; the system does not dynamically adjust hues based on user vision
- **Realtime LLM Generation:** Puzzles are generated algorithmically, not through language model inference
