# Shared Data Standards

Apply shared data standards from this project.

## Standards

@agent-os/standards/shared-data/platform-consumers.md
  <!-- How Python and TypeScript load shared JSON with StrEnum pattern -->

@agent-os/standards/shared-data/source-of-truth.md
  <!-- JSON files in /shared as single source of truth for cross-platform data -->

@agent-os/standards/shared-data/sync-tests.md
  <!-- Tests to catch drift between source JSON and platform consumers -->

## Instructions

When working on shared data-related code:

1. Read the referenced standards above
2. Apply all relevant patterns and conventions
3. If a standard conflicts with the task, ask for clarification
